# Upgrading brunch

## Upgrading to any minor (_.x) version

* Update `package.json` brunch plugins versions to `>= 1.0 < 1.y` where y = brunch minor version + 1. For example, if you use brunch 1.5, you need to use plugins `>= 1.0 < 1.6`. If you use brunch 2.4, you need to use `>= 2.0 < 2.5`
* Run `npm install` to re-install all plugins.

## Upgrading to 1.7

* Rename `config` to `brunch-config` starting with 1.7.6 (`config` is still supported).
* Use `--production` instead of `--optimize` flag for building starting with 1.7.3
  (`--optimize` is still supported, but deprecated).
* Replace `config.paths.{app,test,vendor,assets}` with `config.paths.watched`.
