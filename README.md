# Installation

1. Install Elixir dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Install npm dependencies for ranch with `npm install`
    - on Debuan/Ubuntu "deb.nodesource.com" works great
3. Install bower dependecies with `bower install`
4. Check system dependencies, run postgre dev script below
5. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

# System dependencies

- Erlang/Elixir, of course ;-)
- PostgreSQL (tests run on 9.4, but 9.x shoulb be OK)
    - see config/dev.exs for host/user/port settings
- memcached
    - assumed to run on 127.0.0.1:11211
- npm package manager
    - tested with 1.4.28
- bower package manager
    - tested with 1.3.12

## Create development database

This will create a database "skeleton_dev" owned by "skeleton_dev_user" with password "skeleton_dev_pass". Tune this to yout needs.

```
CREATE ROLE skeleton_dev_user LOGIN
  ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'md5465fc2608ab7a4ebe4eaa198e63b85a7'
  NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION;
CREATE DATABASE skeleton_dev
  WITH OWNER = skeleton_dev_user
       ENCODING = 'UTF8'
       TABLESPACE = pg_default
       LC_COLLATE = 'de_DE.UTF-8'
       LC_CTYPE = 'de_DE.UTF-8'
       CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
```

# Feedback

Is more than welcome. I am still learing this whole Elixir and Erlang/OTP thing so be rude, be harsh but be helpful.
